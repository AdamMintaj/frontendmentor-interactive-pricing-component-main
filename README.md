# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component

## Overwiev

This repository holds my solution to the [Interactive pricing component on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge here was to build a pricing component with some hover states and interactive elements. The user should be able to check prices for different page view numbers and choose their payment plan.
Also, the page layout should adapt to the viewer's device screen size.

## How it went

Honestly, this challenge looked easy-peasy at first, but then I came to the point where I had to style the range input. All the rest was pretty easy but the slider was the devilish part, a real nightmare fuel for a beginner frontend developper. It took me way longer that I initially thought, but I managed to complete it and the few scratches and bruises and vendor prefixes I got in the process will just make me tougher.
